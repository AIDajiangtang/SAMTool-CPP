In the SAMTool-CSharp repository, we use the C# language and the ONNXRuntime for.Net framework to perform inference on the visual large-scale model "Segment Anything", and use WPF to interact with users and display segmentation results.<br/>

In the SAMTool-CPP repository, we will use the C++ language and the ONNXRuntime for CPP framework to perform inference on the visual large-scale model "Segment Anything". This is done for two reasons: first, to improve running efficiency; and second, to have access to source code-level platforms.<br/>

This way, you can deploy the model to embedded devices such as Windows, Linux, and even Android. The UI is not limited to WPF either - you can choose any option between QT, Html, and Winform, and we will provide a version for WPF.<br/>
